# coreinit

## What is coreinit?

coreinit is a modular, minimal bootloader. It aims to provide a clean, extensible startup experience for your operating systems. Written in Turbowarp, it handles system initiation and provides the boot splash and optionally, boot menu and firmware setup.
> *coreinit-firmware-setup is Turbowarp-exclusive; all other sprites work in Scratch.*

## Installation

Simply import the "coreinit" sprite into your project. Remember to make all your scripts start after the "coreboot_boot" message. Optionally, you can also import the "coreinit-bootmenu" and "coreinit-firmware-setup" sprites for a more complete experience.
