# coreinit
## What is coreinit?
coreinit is a modular, minimal bootloader. Written in Turbowarp, it provides the boot splash and optionally, boot menu and firmware setup (Turbowarp-exclusive).
## Installation
Simply import the sprites "coreinit" into your project. Remember to make all your scripts start after the "coreboot_boot" message. Optionally, you can also import the "coreinit-bootmenu" and "coreinit-firmware-setup" sprites for a more complete experience.
